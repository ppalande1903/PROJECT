## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web framework
- **Backend**: Python with dataclasses for data management
- **State Management**: Streamlit session state
- **UI Components**: Custom CSS styling with responsive design

### Libraries Used
- **Streamlit** (>=1.28.0): Web framework for the user interface
- **dataclasses**: Structured data management for candidate information
- **re**: Regular expressions for email and phone validation
- **typing**: Type hints for better code documentation
- **datetime**: Timestamp management

### Core Components

#### 1. CandidateInfo Class
```python
@dataclass
class CandidateInfo:
    full_name: str = ""
    email: str = ""
    phone: str = ""
    experience_years: str = ""
    desired_position: str = ""
    location: str = ""
    tech_stack: List[str] = None
```

#### 2. HiringAssistant Class
Main chatbot logic with conversation management:
- Stage-based conversation flow
- Input validation and sanitization
- Tech stack extraction and question generation
- Context maintenance

### Key Methods

- `get_response()`: Main conversation handler
- `extract_tech_stack()`: Identifies technologies from user input
- `generate_technical_questions()`: Creates relevant technical questions
- `validate_email()` & `validate_phone()`: Input validation
- `is_exit_keyword()`: Detects conversation end requests

## üéØ Prompt Design Strategy

### Information Gathering Prompts
The chatbot uses progressive disclosure, asking for one piece of information at a time to:
- Reduce cognitive load on candidates
- Ensure accurate data collection
- Maintain conversation flow
- Provide clear validation feedback

### Technical Question Generation
Questions are generated based on:
- **Tech Stack Mapping**: Pre-defined question banks for popular technologies
- **Difficulty Balancing**: Mix of fundamental and practical questions
- **Relevance Scoring**: Questions matched to candidate's declared expertise
- **Fallback Strategy**: General technical questions when specific tech not recognized

### Context Management
- **Stage Tracking**: Maintains current conversation stage
- **Information Persistence**: Stores candidate data throughout session
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unexpected inputs
- **Conversation Recovery**: Guides users back on track after errors

## üîß Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Tech Stack Recognition
**Problem**: Accurately identifying technologies from free-form text input
**Solution**: 
- Comprehensive keyword dictionary with common variations
- Case-insensitive matching
- Support for multiple formats (comma-separated, natural language)

### Challenge 2: Question Relevance
**Problem**: Generating appropriate technical questions for diverse skill sets
**Solution**:
- Technology-specific question banks
- Difficulty progression from basic to advanced
- Fallback to general technical questions

### Challenge 3: Conversation Flow Management
**Problem**: Maintaining context and handling unexpected user behavior
**Solution**:
- State machine pattern with defined stages
- Input validation at each stage
- Clear error messages and recovery paths

### Challenge 4: User Experience
**Problem**: Making the screening process engaging and professional
**Solution**:
- Progress tracking with visual indicators
- Friendly, conversational tone
- Clear instructions and expectations
- Professional summary at completion
